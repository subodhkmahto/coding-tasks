Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor (Backend)
This project is the backend for a simplified real-time collaborative document editor similar to Google Docs. It allows multiple users to collaborate on documents in real-time, manage document versions, handle user authentication, and manage permissions for each document.

Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using Clerk.dev for authentication.
Document Management: Users can create, edit, and delete documents.
Real-Time Collaboration: Multiple users can collaborate on the same document using WebSockets.
Version Control: Every document change is tracked with a versioning system.
Permissions: Document owners can share documents with other users and set their permissions (view or edit).
Change Notifications: Users receive notifications when a document they have access to is modified.
Tech Stack

Database Schema
The database is set up using MongoDB and Mongoose ORM. Below is the simplified schema:

User Schema
js
Copy code
{
  id: Number,
  email: String,
  name: String,
  documents: [Document],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
Document Schema
js
Copy code
{
  id: Number,
  title: String,
  content: String,
  owner: User,
  collaborators: [Collaborator],
  versions: [Version],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
Collaborator Schema
js
Copy code
{
  id: Number,
  user: User,
  document: Document,
  role: String // 'view' or 'edit'
}
Version Schema
js
Copy code
{
  id: Number,
  document: Document,
  content: String,
  createdAt: Date
}
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or higher)
MongoDB (Local or MongoDB Atlas)
Clerk.dev account for authentication
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-collab-editor-backend.git
cd real-time-collab-editor-backend
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/myDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
4. Run the server
bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

API Routes
Authentication Routes
POST /api/register: Register a new user
POST /api/login: User login
Document Routes
GET /api/documents: Get all documents for the authenticated user
POST /api/documents: Create a new document
GET /api/documents/:id: Get a single document by ID
PUT /api/documents/:id: Update a document
DELETE /api/documents/:id: Delete a document
Collaboration Routes
POST /api/documents/:id/collaborators: Share a document with a collaborator and set permissions
GET /api/documents/:id/collaborators: Get all collaborators for a document
Version Control Routes
GET /api/documents/:id/versions: Get all versions for a document
WebSocket Integration
WebSocket functionality is implemented using the ws library for real-time collaboration. When a user edits a document, the changes are broadcasted to all connected clients who have access to the document.

Basic WebSocket Workflow
A user connects to the WebSocket server.
Users can send updates to the document in real-time.
The server broadcasts the updates to other collaborators in real-time.
WebSocket connection example in server.js:

js
Copy code
const WebSocket = require('ws');
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client !== ws && client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(message);
      }
    });
  });
});
